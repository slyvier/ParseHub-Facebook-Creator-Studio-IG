# ParseHub-Facebook-Creator-Studio-IG
this is my flowchart to scrap data from facebook creator studio (instagram tab)

this isn't fully automated script, but i already simplified the process so you can proceed with minimal interaction to the script
first you need to download parsehub and upload the script available on this repo

after done with the script, you need to edit the flowchart. before you edit please follow picture below
so you know what you're doing

as you can see in this image, you need to browse to the instagram tab manually (after you login manually on the parsehub browser)

then reach out to the post time filter, open up the selector like in this picture

change the timeline as you need (*remember to select and click every selection)


if you don't understand, i suggest you to follow the parsehub tutorial on youtube before using this script

disclaimer, this script can scrapt at max 17 post so you need to rearrange the script like date 1-17 and 18-31 for each month
and after running the script i recommend you to use auto clicker every 10s (to refresh) to fastening the scrapping process
